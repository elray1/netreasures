There is an ADA accessible trail near Lake Bray, and if you want to extend it a little you can go around the lake. The Goat Peak and Beau Bridges loop brings you first to Goat Peak with scenic views over the valley, and then down a path along a small stream. For a longer hike, the NET/M-M trail leads along the mountain ridge with great views at several spots.","Water Views, Accessible Trails, Walking/Hiking - Easy, Walking/Hiking - Medium",
