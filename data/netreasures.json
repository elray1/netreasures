There is an ADA accessible trail near Lake Bray, and if you want to extend it a little you can go around the lake. The Goat Peak and Beau Bridges loop brings you first to Goat Peak with scenic views over the valley, and then down a path along a small stream. For a longer hike, the NET/M-M trail leads along the mountain ridge with great views at several spots.", "tags": ["Water Views", "Accessible Trails", "Walking/Hiking - Easy", "Walking/Hiking - Medium"], "picture": ""}]
